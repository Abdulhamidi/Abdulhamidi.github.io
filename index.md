## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 2

    This was a fun lab because I did the Julian Days program that could solve the number of days between two dates. The main challenge here would be implementing Fliegel & Van Flandern's formula in this program to convert any given date into a Julian day. Once I got this worked out, applying the difference between two Julian Days and printing the result was only a tiny step. Having run the program for different dates, it was satisfying to see the correct number of days printed, including leap years and date differences over long periods.

* Lab 9, part 1

    This lab was my second favorite lab, as it was about building a spell checker. The main challenge was reading the dictionary and document files and comparing what's in them. I first handled command-line arguments, ensuring a filename was passed in correctly. Then, I developed the reading of words from the two files into vectors. The biggest challenge was to check each word of the document to see if it was in the dictionary. Once all the pieces fit together, it was satisfying when the program correctly identified some misspellings. In summary, it was a very good exercise in file processing and string manipulation.

* Lab 11

    This was my favorite lab because I enjoyed all the parts of this lab. In Part 1, I implemented a State class by using object-oriented programming, calculating population densities, and identifying the densest and sparsest states. It was satisfying to manipulate real-world data and make sure the program worked with the help of automated tests. In Part 2, I took object-oriented principles and applied them to a fun, interactive Hi-Lo game. I developed a GameState class that maintained the state of the game by tracking guesses and checking if the guess was correct, too high, or too low. The combination of class design, game logic, and testing made this lab both fun and educational.
